os suggestion 
1. MS-DOS (Disk Operating System)
 Why good for a case stud
Simple text-based interface.

Direct control over file system, memory, and processes via commands.

Easy to write small assembly or C programs to interact with system interrupts.

Manipulatable functions:

File handling (COPY, DEL, TYPE commands or INT 21H in assembly).

Memory management (viewing free space, loading TSR programs).

Device I/O via simple drivers.




2. Linux (Lightweight distro like Lubuntu or Tiny Core Linux)
Why good:


Open source — can inspect kernel code if needed.

Rich set of system calls for process, memory, and file management.

Easy scripting in Bash for automation.

Manipulatable functions:

Process control (ps, kill, nice).

File permissions and user management.

Kernel parameters via /proc and /sys.

3. Minix 3
Why good:

Designed for teaching OS concepts (used by Tanenbaum in Modern Operating Systems).

Very small and modular microkernel.

Can modify kernel modules and rebuild easily.

Manipulatable functions:

Process scheduling.

Device driver loading/unloading.

File system internals.

4. xv6 (Educational Unix-like OS)
Why good:

Minimal Unix OS designed for MIT’s OS course.

Written in C, small enough to read in days.

Can run in QEMU or VirtualBox.

Manipulatable functions:

Add/modify system calls.

Change scheduler.

Modify file system behavior.

5. Nachos or PintOS (Simulation-based OS projects)
Why good:

Runs in a controlled simulator — no risk to your real PC.

Perfect for implementing or modifying OS components without hardware issues.

Manipulatable functions:

Thread scheduling.

Virtual memory implementation.

File system logic.
