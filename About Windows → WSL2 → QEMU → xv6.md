## **About Windows → WSL2 → QEMU → xv6**

*Stepwise view*
&nbsp; Windows 11 → runs WSL2 Ubuntu (host os)
&nbsp; WSL2 → runs QEMU emulator
&nbsp; QEMU → boots xv6 kernel
&nbsp; xv6 → runs shell and user programs inside QEMU

  | Component | Role |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|
| **WSL2**  |  Linux environment inside Windows |
| **QEMU**  |  CPU/machine emulator and virtualizer |
| **xv6** | Tiny OS that runs inside QEMU |
  
  1️⃣ Windows 11

      Your host OS.
   Runs PowerShell, Windows Terminal, and the WSL2 subsystem .

  2️⃣ WSL2  (Windows Subsystem for Linux version 2)
             
       a lightweight Linux environment inside Windows 11.

  You install Ubuntu (or other distro) via Microsoft Store.

Provides:
* Linux filesystem
* Package manager (apt)
* Bash shell
* Linux kernel features via a tiny VM

  You can run Linux commands, install packages (gcc, qemu, etc.), and compile programs.

     - WSL2 itself does not emulate xv6 — it just provides the environment to build    and run xv6.
          - where you install all the tools xv6 needs:

               &nbsp;  `sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential 
                git gdb-multiarch qemu-system-riscv gcc-riscv64-                    unknown-elf`

  
 3️⃣ QEMU

        a virtual CPU and machine emulator.
        
   For xv6-RISC-V, QEMU emulates a RISC-V CPU, memory, and simple devices.

  When you run:

   &nbsp;  *make qemu*

  Inside your xv6-riscv folder:

  QEMU
* starts an emulated RISC-V CPU.

* Emulates memory, disk, console, and devices.

* Boots the xv6 kernel inside this emulated machine.

     *QEMU runs as a process inside WSL2, so Windows doesn’t directly run xv6 — it’s just running QEMU inside WSL2.*

4️⃣ xv6
      
       a tiny Unix-like OS.

   - It cannot run natively on Windows — it needs a RISC-V CPU.
    -   QEMU provides that CPU and devices.

xv6 boots inside the QEMU terminal, where you see:

     xv6 kernel is booting
        
     init: starting sh
     $

  
  - $ is the xv6 shell — you can run programs, modify kernel, and test syscalls.

       **NOTE : Run xv6 on WSL2 + QEMU**
- You use WSL2 as the Linux environment to install the toolchain (gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf, qemu, etc.).
- Then you clone xv6, compile it, and launch it inside QEMU.
- xv6 itself is not installed on Windows directly — it always runs in the simulated RISC-V machine provided by QEMU.
