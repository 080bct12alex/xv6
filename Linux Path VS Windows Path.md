| Prompt        | Meaning                                                                |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/`           | Root directory of the entire filesystem.                               |
| `/home`       | You are in the `/home` directory.                                      |
| `~`           | You are in your home directory (same as `/home/alex`).                 |
| `/home/alex`  | Same as `~`, but shown as the full path.                               |
| `~/xv6-riscv` | Inside the `xv6-riscv` folder in your home directory.                  |
| `.`           | Refers to the current directory.                                       |
| `..`          | Refers to the parent directory (one level up from the current folder). |


1\. alex@ALEX:/home$
- alex → your username.
- ALEX → the hostname (name of your computer).
- : →the part after : in the prompt always shows your current directory
- /home → the current working directory.
- $ → indicates you are a normal user (not root).
This means you are in the /home directory.

2\. alex@ALEX:~$
- ~ is a shortcut for your home directory same as /home/alex.
- It’s just shorter and more convenient.

3\. alex@ALEX:~/xv6-riscv$
- ~/xv6-riscv means a folder named xv6-riscv inside your home directory (/home/alex/xv6-riscv).
So now your terminal’s current directory is inside the xv6-riscv project folder.

| User folder  | Exists?                  | Access                         |
|--------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `/home/alex` | Yes, if user alex exists | Only alex (or root) can access |
| `/home/messi`  | Yes, if user messi exists  | Only messi (or root) can access  |
| `/home`      | Always exists            | All users can see their own subfolders, root can see all |

***To check all users*** 
 - look at /etc/passwd file:
                
                cat /etc/passwd
    It lists all users on the system.

# THUS

**When you are at:**



**alex@ALEX:~$**
 - The ~ symbol represents your home directory. For user alex, this is:
                       
                       /home/alex

When you type:
              
      cd ..

.. means the parent directory. So from /home/alex, it goes up one level to:             /home

If you want to go back to your personal home from */home*, just type:
                 
      cd

   or
     
      cd ~

It will take you back to your home directory (/home/alex).

✅ So:
 - cd .. → go up one directory
- cd or cd ~ → go back to your home directory


**When you see:**



**alex@ALEX:/home$**
- It means your current directory is  
        
            /home , 
- not your personal home yet.

In Linux, the home directory for a user /personal home is usually:

    /home/username

So for you, alex’s personal home directory is:
      
      /home/alex

- /home itself is just the parent directory that contains all users’ home directories.

So:

| Prompt              | Meaning                                                                 |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `alex@ALEX:~$`      | You are in your home directory `/home/alex`.                           |
| `alex@ALEX:/home$`  | You are in the parent directory `/home`, which is the container for all user folders (e.g., `/home/alex`, `/home/ram`). |
                   

## Linux Path VS Windows Path

| Linux Path             | Windows Path                        | Meaning                                              |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `/`                    | `C:\`                               | Root of the entire filesystem / drive                |
| `/home`                | `C:\Users\`                         | Container for all user folders                       |
| `/home/alex`           | `C:\Users\Alex`                     | Alex’s personal folder (home directory)             |
| `/home/alex/xv6-riscv` | `C:\Users\Alex\xv6-riscv`           | A project folder inside Alex’s folder               |
| `/etc`                 | `C:\Windows\System32` (or Registry) | System configuration files and settings            |
| `/bin`                 | `C:\Windows\System32`               | Essential system executables and commands           |
| `/usr/bin`             | `C:\Program Files`                  | User-installed programs and binaries                |

✅ Key Idea:

- Linux uses forward slashes / and Windows uses backslashes \\ .
- Linux home directory (~) = Windows user directory (C:\\Users\\Username).
