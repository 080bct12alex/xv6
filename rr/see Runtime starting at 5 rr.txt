why  Runtime starting at 5 ?

this is because ttime is already non-zero before scheduler() starts running.

In XV6, ttime is incremented not only in your scheduler loop, but also sometimes during process setup or the first context switch. Thatâ€™s why even your first call to print_proc_stats() sees ttime > 0.
